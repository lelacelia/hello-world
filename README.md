# hello-world
First repository to practice using GitHub

Hi, my name is Linh-Anh Le. You can call me Celia. 
In my free time, I like watching tennis, cooking (without having to do the dishes), and exercising.
I am new to GitHub and currently am trying to learn Python and building out my DS portfolio at the same time!

Toodles!
